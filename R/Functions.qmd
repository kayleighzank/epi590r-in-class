## 2.4 Exercises

1.  Create a new R script or quarto file and write a function to square a number. Youâ€™re tired of writing `x^2` when you want to square `x`, so you want a function to square a number. You can call it `square()`. I showed this in the slides, now try on your own!

```{r}
x <- 4

x^2

square <- function (x) {x^2}
	
square(x)
square(53)
53^2
```

```{r}
log_transform <- function(x) {
	log(x)
}

log_transform(x)
log(x)
```

```{r}
reciprocal <- function(x) {
	1/x
}

x
reciprocal(x)
```
