## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

`eval: false` - don't evaluate (run) that chunk

`error: true` - render this even if the chunk causes an error

`cache: true` - store the results of this chunk so that it doesn't need to re-run every time

`warning: false` - don't print warnings

`message: false` - don't print messages

#\| = option for just this chunk

use YAML (top section of document) to select an option the entire document, YAML is VERY picky about it's format

-   can change theme of the document in the YAML also

```{r}
x <- 9
x
x + 19
```

```{r}
library(flextable)
t <- mtcars
as_flextable(t)
```
